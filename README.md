# BEP-Local-Mesh-Refinement-via-Python-and-SU2
This repository has been created to store all work done on the Bachelor Final Project by Femke van den Elzen.
The project focussed on creating an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm in Python that will perform a local mesh refinement on a two-dimensional SU2 mesh.
In this repository the mesh files, final code, and all codes that have been made in the process will be displayed.
